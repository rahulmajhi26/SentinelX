## Features

- **VirusTotal Integration:** Analyze files, IPs, URLs, and domains for malware, phishing, and suspicious activity using VirusTotal's public API.
- **IOC Collection & Analysis:** Input Indicators of Compromise (hashes, IP addresses, domains) to fetch detailed threat intelligence.
- **Threat Actor Tracking:** Aggregate threat data to help profile and monitor potential attackers.
- **Automated Reporting:** Generate detailed HTML and text reports summarizing investigation results.
- **Modular CLI Interface:** Easy-to-use command-line interface with modular design for extensibility.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Designed primarily for Linux but compatible with other UNIX-like systems.
- **Real-Time Alerts Simulation:** Simulate real-time detection alerts for security operations readiness.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher  
- Git  
- Internet connection (for API calls)

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SentinelX.git
cd SentinelX
````

### Step 2: Install dependencies

It's recommended to use a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*If `requirements.txt` does not exist yet, you can install dependencies manually like `requests`.*

### Step 3: Configure API Keys

Sign up on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) to get a free API key.
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:

```
VT_API_KEY=your_virustotal_api_key_here
```

---

## Usage

Run the main tool script with Python:

```bash
python3 sentinelx.py
```

You will see an interactive CLI menu to:

* Scan an IP address
* Scan a domain
* Scan a file hash (MD5, SHA256)
* Generate detailed reports

Follow on-screen prompts to enter the data you want to investigate.

---

## Configuration

* API keys are loaded from `.env` file using `python-dotenv` (make sure to install it).
* Customize output folders and report formats inside the script if needed.

---

## API Integration

SentinelX currently supports VirusTotal API for threat intelligence. The tool sends requests to VirusTotal's endpoints to retrieve information about submitted IOCs.

*Note:* VirusTotal's free API has request rate limits. For heavy usage, consider upgrading your API subscription.

---

## How It Works

1. **User Input:** The user inputs an IOC (IP, domain, file hash).
2. **API Query:** SentinelX queries VirusTotal API with the IOC.
3. **Data Processing:** The tool processes JSON responses, extracts relevant threat details.
4. **Threat Correlation:** It correlates data such as malware detections, related URLs, and threat actors.
5. **Reporting:** Generates a human-readable report summarizing all findings.
